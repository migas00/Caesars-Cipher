# Caesars-Cipher
The Caesar cipher shifts characters by a fixed number within the alphabet, wrapping around cyclically if needed. It encrypts by moving forward and decrypts by reversing the shift. Simple yet fast, it works for letters, numbers, or symbols but is insecure due to easy decryption via brute force or frequency analysis.
